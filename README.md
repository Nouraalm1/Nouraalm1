# 👋 Hi there, this is Norah — or in short, Nora! 😊

🎓 I’m currently pursuing a **Master of Applied Computing**, with a Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science and Engineering**.

💻 I have experience working with:
- **Java**
- **Python**
- **MySQL**

🛠️ During my bachelor's, I took a **Software Engineering** course that sparked my interest in this field. It motivated me to join this course to further deepen my understanding of **development and design**.

🌐 I’m also excited to dive deeper into **web development**, explore various **frameworks**, and find the one that best suits my needs for building well-structured and efficient web applications.

🚀 Looking forward to growing my skills and building something awesome!
